    <p>Bards bring levity during grave times; they impart wisdom to offset ignorance; and they make the ridiculous seem sublime. Bards are preservers of ancient history, their songs and tales perpetuating the memory of great events down through time — knowledge so important that it is memorized and passed along as oral history, to survive even when no written record remains.<br><br>It is also the bard’s role to chronicle smaller and more contemporary events — the stories of today’s heroes, including their feats of valor as well as their less than impressive failures.<br><br>Of course, the world has many people who can carry a tune or tell a good story, and there’s much more to any adventuring bard than a glib tongue and a melodious voice. Yet what truly sets bards apart from others — and from one another — are the style and substance of their performances.</p>
